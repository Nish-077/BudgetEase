Obtain bill/transaction image from user -> Feed it to Gemini API LLM -> Output: Transaction Object.

Remove reference of User from Transaction and Budget Classes, this is because User is the one who OWNS these objects 
and User has the responsibility of creating Transaction and Budget objects -> In compliance with CREATOR GRASP principles.

RewardAccount class handles all activities regarding Rewards, User owns the RewardAccount.

Remove Category class because it is too redundant and doesn't hold too much unique info.

Instead, add a category field in Budget and have Transaction belong to Budget to allow easy tracking.

On top of this, make an abstract class which Budget and Goal inherits from.


REWARDS -

grant 10 points for adding budget/goal //This works properly

grant 50 points for 20 transactions.
grant 100 points for completion of budget/goal and BRONZE badge.

REWARD ACCOUNT MUST HAVE BOTH THE ABOVE ADDED TO IT. - REWARD ACC HAS 25 FOR TRANSACTION BUT TWO COMPOSITE ONES
